== Turbo.visit

[,js]
----
Turbo.visit(location)
Turbo.visit(location, { action: action })
----

Performs an link:/handbook/drive#application-visits[Application Visit] to the given _location_ (a string containing a URL or path) with the specified _action_ (a string, either `"advance"` or `"replace"`).

If _location_ is a cross-origin URL, or falls outside of the specified root (see link:/handbook/drive#setting-a-root-location[Setting a Root Location]), Turbo performs a full page load by setting `window.location`.

If _action_ is unspecified, Turbo Drive assumes a value of `"advance"`.

Before performing the visit, Turbo Drive fires a `turbo:before-visit` event on `document`. Your application can listen for this event and cancel the visit with `event.preventDefault()` (see link:/handbook/drive#canceling-visits-before-they-start[Canceling Visits Before They Start]).

== Turbo.clearCache

[,js]
----
Turbo.clearCache()
----

Removes all entries from the Turbo Drive page cache. Call this when state has changed on the server that may affect cached pages.

== Turbo.setProgressBarDelay

[,js]
----
Turbo.setProgressBarDelay(delayInMilliseconds)
----

Sets the delay after which the link:/handbook/drive#displaying-progress[progress bar] will appear during navigation, in milliseconds. The progress bar appears after 500ms by default.

Note that this method has no effect when used with the iOS or Android adapters.

== Turbo.session.drive

[,js]
----
Turbo.session.drive = false
----

Turns Turbo Drive off by default. You must now opt-in to Turbo Drive on a per-link and per-form basis using `data-turbo="true"`.
