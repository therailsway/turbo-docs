Turbo Native for iOS provides the tooling to wrap your Turbo-enabled web app in a native iOS shell. It manages a single WKWebView instance across multiple view controllers, giving you native navigation UI with all the client-side performance benefits of Turbo. See https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios[Turbo Native: iOS] for more details.

Turbo Native for Android provides the same kind of tooling, managing a single WebView instance across multiple Fragment destinations. See https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android[Turbo Native: Android] for more details.

The best way to see what's possible with the native adapters is to setup the demo native application. We have one https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios/blob/main/Demo/README.md[for iOS] and https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android/blob/main/demo/README.md[for Android]. You can open the code in your native environments and follow along to explore all the features.
